For this exercise, I'm choosing Python as my language, as it is a very popular and widely used language.

Linting ensures that our code adheres to style guidelines and is free of common syntax issues. In Python, a contender that has gained popularity as a fast and efficient linter is **Ruff**. Known for its speed, Ruff performs linting and formatting in one tool, making it an excellent choice for enforcing code quality.

Automatic testing is crucial for catching functional issues in code, lest broken software be shipped to end users. **Pytest** is a powerful and versatile testing framework that supports both unit and integration tests, making it a popular choice for complex projects.

Python, being an interpreted language, doesn't require a build step.

To set up CI, I have decided to go with **CircleCI**. Featuring a user-friendly interface, CircleCI is a highly flexible and scalable solution, providing both cloud-based and self-hosted options. This allows teams to start quickly on the cloud and migrate to on-premises as the project grows.

While the project is small, our team could use CircleCI's cloud solution, which includes a free tier up to a certain usage limit. As the project grows, we could upgrade to a higher tier of CircleCI with more features, while gradually preparing and adapting for a self-hosted setup to save further in the long run.
